# KauthRecipes
Old Static Recipes Site

Years ago these were wirtten on index cards.
Later they were in word documents, and printed.
After that they belonged to a static website, that loaded the selected recipe with javascript.
The design was updated a few years ago to try to be responsive, but it never really worked out.

I am uploading this as is, to keep a copy of the original.
