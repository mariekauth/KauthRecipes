<b>Tator Tot Casserole</b>
<br><br>
1 lb Ground Beef<br>
3 cans Cream of mushroom soup<br>
2 can French Style Green Beans<br>
1 bag Tator Tots<br>
1 can French's Dried Onions<br>
1 lb Shredded Cheese (Colby works best)
<br><br>
Preheat oven to 305&deg;
<br><br>
Fry your hamburger. Drain it well.
Mix the ground beef, cream of mushroom soup, and green beans in the bottom of a casserole dish.

Put a single layer of tator tots over the dish. Make sure you cover all of it.

Bake for 35 minutes - 1 hour (Generally follow the instructions on the tator tots).

At the last 5-10 minutes of cooking add your dried onions and cover them with cheese. 
Bake until the cheese is melted.

Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken. (If you do not wait it will run and not come out neatly. Besides it is too hot to eat anyway).

*Note: Always put the onions on &quot;UNDER&quot; the cheese or they will burn.
