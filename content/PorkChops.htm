<b>Pork Chops</b><br>
<br>
1 pkg Pork Chops/Beef<br>
1 Chopped Onion<br>
Flour<br>
Salt<br>
Pepper<br>
Cooking Oil or Spray<br>
Bullion (If you have it)<br>
Water<br>
<br>
Preheat Oven to 350&deg;<br>
<br>
Put the flour in a shallow dish and salt and pepper to taste. 
Rinse the pork chops under running water. Some people prefer to pat dry after. 
Dip Pork Chops in flour.
Brown Pork Chops in a hot skillet (light greased so they do not stick).
Place Pork Chops in baking pan (lightly greased so they do not stick).
Place sliced onion on top of the pork chops.
Cover them with water or bullion, just enough to cover the meat. (You can add about 4 bullion cubes if you have them).<br>
<br>
This recipe makes the gravy while you are cooking your pork chops. I personally like to serve my gravy over mashed potatoes.
<br><br>
Bake at 350&deg; for about 2 hours, when meat is tender it is done.<br>

*Note: (It tastes even better when you cook Pork and Beef together)
